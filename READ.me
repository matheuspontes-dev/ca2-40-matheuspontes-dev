Sorting Dummy List of People
Merge sort is the best fit for sorting the employee list because it always gives fast and reliable results, even as the list gets bigger. Unlike simpler algorithms 
like insertion sort, which slow down a lot as the list grows, merge sort keeps its speed no matter how much data we have. It also keeps employees with the same name in
their original order, which can be important for the records. While quicksort is sometimes faster, it can be unpredictable and is not stable. Merge sortâ€™s predictable
performance and stability make it the safest and most consistent choice for this project.


Search in the list and Return Relevant Information
Binary search is much faster than checking each name one by one, especially as the list gets bigger. It quickly finds the name by repeatedly narrowing down the search
range, making it much more efficient than linear search. Since my list is already sorted, binary search is the best choice for speed and efficiency.
